## Training

### Processing dataset
Before training, you need to download the oringal data from [coco](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/coco-2017-dataset)(include 2017 train,val and annotations), nuswide [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11w3J98uL_KHWn9j22GeKWc5K_AYM5U3V/view?usp=drive_link), mirflickr25k [Baidu, 提取码:u9e1](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1upgnBNNVfBzMiIET9zPfZQ) or [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18oGgziSwhRzKlAjbqNZfj-HuYzbxWYTh/view?usp=sharing) (include mirflickr25k and mirflickr25k_annotations_v080), then use the "data/make_XXX.py" to generate .mat file

### Download CLIP pretrained model
Pretrained model will be found in the 30 lines of [CLIP/clip/clip.py](https://github.com/openai/CLIP/blob/main/clip/clip.py). This code is based on the "ViT-B/32".
